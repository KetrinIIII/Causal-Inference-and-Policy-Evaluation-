Colonial Plantations and Their Role in Shaping Modern Economies: Evidence from IV Analysis

This paper explores the long-term economic effects of colonial plantation economies on post-colonial development, with a specific focus on the level of plantation economies during the colonial period and their relationship to GDP per capita in 2012. Using a dataset of 31 former colonies in Asia and Africa, we employ both ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression models to examine the impact of colonial plantation presence on modern economic outcomes. The study addresses endogeneity concerns by using the extent of plan- tations during the colonial period as an instrumental variable. Our results reveal a significant positive association between the level of colonial plantation economies and GDP per capita in 2012, indicating that regions with more significant plan- tation economies during the colonial period experienced higher levels of economic development in the modern era. The findings contribute to understanding the lasting economic legacies of colonialism and provide insights into the factors that shaped contemporary economic disparities between former colonies.
